# Password_Cracker
Brute-Force Password Cracker This is a simple Brute-Force Password Cracker program written in C++. It uses a recursive approach to try all possible combinations of a given password using lowercase English letters (a-z). The program supports password lengths up to 6 characters and displays a progress bar to track the cracking process.

# Features:
-Password Cracking: Tries every combination of lowercase letters (a-z) to find the correct password.
-Progress Bar: Visual representation of progress as the password combinations are tested.
-Time Measurement: Measures and displays the time taken to crack the password.
-ASCII Art: Simple ASCII art used to enhance the user interface.

# How it Works:
-User Input: The user enters the password to crack, which is limited to 6 characters and can only consist of lowercase English letters.
-Recursive Brute Force: The program uses recursion to try every possible combination of characters in the password.
-Progress Bar: As the program runs, a progress bar is shown to display the current status of the brute-force attack.
-Result: If the password is found, it will display the cracked password along with the time taken. If the password is not found, it will display a message indicating the failure.
